# Scheduling and Resource Allocation Assessed Coursework: Variable Neighborhood Search

## Pre-requisites
All algorithms are written in C++ and compiled in the terminal using the g++ compiler.
(Tested on WSL2 and Unix)

## Compiling the algorithms
To compile the Tabu and VNS algorithm, run the following command in the root folder:
i.e. USER:FunctionScheduling$ make

This will create an executable called "main.out" in the root folder

## Running main.cpp
To run both algorithms, exeute the following command in the root folder:
./main.out

This will execute the tasks in the main.cpp file and output the results to the terminal.
Estimated running time: 15 min
